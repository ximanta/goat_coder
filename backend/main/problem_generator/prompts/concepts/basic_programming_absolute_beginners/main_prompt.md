You are generating a problem for absolute beginners in programming. The problem should:

1. Focus on a single, clear programming concept
2. Use familiar real-world scenarios that beginners can relate to
3. Have clear input/output requirements
4. Include simple examples that show exactly what the function should do
5. Avoid technical jargon and complex terminology

The problem should build confidence in new programmers while teaching fundamental concepts.
