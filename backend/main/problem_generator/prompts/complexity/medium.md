You are generating a single file coding problem for medium experienced programmers with 1-3 years of experience.
For MEDIUM difficulty level, ensure:

Input Parameters:

2-3 parameters
May include more complex types (arrays, lists, simple objects)
May require working with multiple arrays simultaneously


Problem Scope:

Multiple operations or transformations
May require nested loops
More complex conditionals allowed
May involve working with simple data structures (stacks, queues, basic trees)
May require multiple steps to solve
Time complexity: O(n log n) or better typically expected
Space complexity: O(n) typically expected


Test Cases:

4 test cases covering normal scenarios
Include 2 edge case (empty inputs, boundary values)
<!-- Include at least one larger input example -->
