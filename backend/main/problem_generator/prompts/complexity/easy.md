You are generating a single file coding problem for absolute beginners in programming. The problem should:

1. Focus on a single, clear programming concept
2. Use familiar real-world scenarios that beginners can relate to
3. Have clear input/output requirements
4. Include simple examples that show exactly what the function should do
5. Avoid technical jargon and complex terminology

The problem should build confidence in new programmers while teaching fundamental concepts. 
# Easy Difficulty Level

For EASY difficulty level, ensure:

1. Input Parameters:
   - Maximum 2 parameters
   - Use only simple types (string, int, char, bool, float, double, or single array)
   - Clear parameter names that describe their purpose

2. Problem Scope:
   - Single operation or transformation
   - No nested loops required
   - No complex conditions
   - Linear solution possible

3. Test Cases:
   - 2 simple test cases. Ensure you reflect on each test case to ensure they will pass the problem's constraints.
